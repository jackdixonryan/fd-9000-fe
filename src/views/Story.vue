        <h2>The Lost Mines of Phandelver</h2>
        <p>
            More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver's Pact, 
            by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral 
            wealth, the mine contained great magical power. Human spellcasters allied themselves with the dwarves and gnomes 
            to channel and bind that energy into a great forge (called the Forge of Spells), where magic items could be 
            crafted. Times were good, and the nearby human town of Phandalin (pronounced fan-duh-lin) prospered as well. 
            But then disaster struck when ores swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path.
        </p>
        <p>
            A powerful force of orcs reinforced by evil mercenary wizards attacked Wave Echo Cave to seize its riches 
            and magic treasures. Human wizards fought alongside their dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge of 
            Spells, and the ensuing spell battle destroyed much of the cavern. Few survived the cave-ins and tremors, 
            and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.
        </p>
        <p>
            For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around 
            Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine. In recent years, people have resettled 
            the area. Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble frontier town. More important, the Rockseeker siblings-a trio 
            of dwarves- have discovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave, and they intend to reopen the mines.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately for the Rockseekers, they are not the only ones interested in Wave Echo Cave. Mysterious 
            villains known as Glasstaff and The Black Spider control a network of bandit gangs and goblin tribes in the area,
            and their agents have followed the Rockseekers to their prize. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Will Glasstaff and The Black Spider successfully mine Wave Echo Cave? Will the Forge of Spells be lost to evil forever? 
            Will Oink and Klil live on in the hearts of our heroes throughout the rest of their lives? 
            Tune in usually on Sundays to find out in the continuing thrilling saga of: The lost mines of Phandelver.
